I want to make a platform for users to doing research and analysis on the language data, archeology, genetics, and remote sensing + GIS data.

Below is some of my requests:

DATABASE

Requests:
1. For language data, I want to use CLDF to unite spoken language, sign language and mayan language data.
2. For archeology and genetics data, think of a way to unite them with language data describe above.

Techonoly used:
Use DuckDB

FRONTEND

Requests:
1. The whole system is single page application. It should be similar to KeplerGL about the main functionalitys of the data interaction.
2. The application contains a map view, data view, and chatbox for LLM interaction.
3. The map view could be 2.5D or 2D. It should be able to display to vector data, when clicking to the vector data, it should display the draggble popup which can include video or image, or just text depends on the data type.
    3.1. For sign language, it should be able to display video
    3.2. For archeology, it should be able to display image
    3.3. For genetics, it should be able to display image
4. The data view is a table view, and users can search and filter data.
5. The chatbox is a chat interface for users to interact with LLM.
6. The GIS data such as vector data or raster data should be able to display on the map view.

Techonoly used:
Use React for frontend.
Use Deckgl for map view.        
Use Ollama for LLM interaction.

TILING SERVER
Think of a way to tile raster data and vector data to display it on the map

BACKEND
You should propose an orchestration architecture for the backend to handle the data interaction from the users.

I have some requirements for the backend technology used:
1. Use DuckDB, Ollama for LLM, and FastAPI for API.
